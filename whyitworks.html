                 <p align="center"><b>What is health data?</b></p>
                 <p>Health data is any recorded information related to an individual’s health status or health risk. Examples include medical protocols and conclusions, 
                    reproductive outcomes, labs results, sleep patterns, scans, x-rays, genome, etc.</p>

                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <p>According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, “Individually identifiable health information” is 
                     information, including demographic data, that relates to: (1) the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental 
                     health or condition, (2) the provision of health care to the individual, or (3) the past, present, or future payment for 
                     the provision of health care to the individual, and (4) that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable 
                     basis to believe can be used to identify the individual.13 Individually identifiable health information includes many common 
                     identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).
                     <a href=”https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/privacysummary.pdf?language=es”>(US HSS)</a>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                    In addition to clinical data, OMNI INDI also incorporates other health related data. Personal activity tracking data from devices/wearables, 
                    such as fitbit or blood glucose monitors are also included to better assess each users' health.  
                 <br>
                 <br> 
                    OMNI INDI also includes environmental data such as air quality for both indoor (building sensors) and outdoor (geographic sensors). 
                    On a TED Talk and the book "The Upstream Doctors," the author and doctor Rishi Manchanda says “zip code matters more than genetic code 
                    when it comes to health outcomes.”<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rishi_manchanda_what_makes_us_get_sick_look_upstream">(TED talk)</a> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    OMNI INDI captures all facets that impact an individual's health.

                 <p align="center"><b>What does owning your health data mean?</b></p>
                 <p>By owning their health data, users can (1) travel between insurance systems, geographic boundaries, and all types of care 
                    providers without losing data fidelity, (2) view their health data at any time to ensure they are following the doctor’s orders, 
                    (3) combine additional layers of information to include environmental data and family history, (4) have quick access to their full and 
                    accurate data in times of emergencies, and (5) control the outflow of data to either healthcare providers, researchers, insurers, or public health.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                   For example, when the user goes to a healthcare facility for a check up, the recorded blood pressure and notes from the visit are 
                   directly uploaded onto the user's OMNI INDI health portal. That specific healthcare facility would still retain a copy of that data, 
                   however he/she is in control who that data is being shared with. This prevents data miners from obtaining and selling the user's health 
                   and personal data without his/her consent. In relevant situations, such as when making a doctor's appointment, the user will be asked 
                   to grant a time-capped access for the doctor to see his/her data 15-30 minutes prior to the appointment through 60 minutes following the visit.

                 <br>
                 <p align="center"><b>How about for the research community?</b></p>
                 <p>Robust, longitudinal health data sets are hard to come by, especially when the reseach is around specific demographics or health 
                   conditions. With OMNI INDI, health data includes not just discharge data, but environmental data, family data, and personal device 
                   data. This layered collection of quantified data and social data is far richer than the data currently available to researchers 
                   from hospital consortiums and can be purchased on the OMNI INDI Marketplace. Individual users of OMNI INDI decide what data they 
                   want to sell for personal profit and what data they want to keep private. So when a researcher visits the Exchange, they can query 
                   for specific metrics, see the current price of that data query, and directly purchase data, or, they can create incentives to attract 
                   additional, or new, users.

                 <!-- <p align="center"><b>How is OMNI INDI unique?</b></p>
                 <p>Unlike Apple Health where the user does not own their health data, but rather primarily scans in copies of health records, 
                   and unlike proprietary health record systems like EPIC where you can’t move data between specialists, primary providers, and 
                   urgent care, OMNI INDI coalesces all health data directly from the generation source into one location which goes where the 
                   patient goes, because they are the owners. </p> -->
