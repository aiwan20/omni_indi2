                 <p align="center"><b>HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</b></p>
                 <p>The primary government policy related to healthcare data is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. 
                   HIPAA was signed into law in 1996 and has been consistently modified to provider further protection to individuals over the evolving 
                   landscape. Two primary areas of focus are privacy and security.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   HIPAA is comprised of five parts, or Titles:
                   <br>
                   <u>Title I</u>: Health Care Access, Portability, and Renewability <br>
                   <u>Title II</u>: Preventing Health Care Fraud and Abuse; Administrative Simplification; Medical Liability Reform <br>
                   <u>Title III</u>: Tax-related Health Provisions Governing Medical Savings Accounts <br>
                   <u>Title IV</u>: Application and Enforcement of Group Health Insurance Requirements <br>
                   <u>Title V</u>: Revenue Offset Governing Tax Deductions for Employers <br>
                   <br>
                   The Privacy Rule and Security Rule fall under Title II. In January 2016, HIPAA was updated to increase patient access to health information. 
                   The changes were designed to clarify how patients may access their health information, to include electronic health records. Specifically, 
                   in section 45 CFR 164.524(c)(2)(i), an individual request for protected health information must be fulfilled within 30 days for no more 
                   than a cost-based fee. But more importantly, the provision requires health entities to provide an electronic copy if requested. This 
                   policy change increased both access and care transparency for patients.

                   <p align="center"><b>HCUP – Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project</b>
                   <br>
                   HCUP includes the largest collection of all-payer, encounter-level hospital care data in the United States.
                   <br>
                   “HCUP is a family of health care databases, software tools, supplemental files, reports, and other related products developed 
                   through a Federal-State-Industry partnership and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). The project 
                   builds on the data collection efforts of State data organizations, hospital associations, and private data organizations (known as 
                   “HCUP Partners"). Without HCUP Partners’ voluntary data contributions, this national resource supporting health services research 
                   and policy would not be possible."<a href="https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/news/exhibit_booth/HCUPFactSheet.pdf">(read more)</a>
                   <br>
                   HCUP’s partners are not patients and HCUP does not have patient consent.

                 <p>Data standardization is at the core of OMNI INDI. <br>
                  <br>
                     Health data operates among unique software systems, database structures, political environments, and financial 
                     relationships. Every hospital, lab, specialist, treatment center, and clinic has a unique way in which to collect, 
                     store, access, and utilize data. Standardization allows healthcare entities to interact with both data, and patients.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    “<u>Health Level-7 (HL7)</u> is a set of international standards for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software 
                    applications used by various healthcare providers. These standards focus on the application layer, which is “layer 7" in the 
                    Open Systems Interconnection model. The HL7 standards are adopted by the American National Standards Institute and the 
                    International Organization for Standardization."<a href="http://www.fortherecordmag.com/archives/ftr_01082007p22.shtml">(read more)</a>

                    <br>
                    Simply put, HL7 is a messaging standard enabling clinical applications to exchange data.
