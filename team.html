                 <p>As a senior engineer at Honeywell, Vivek worked on rapid prototyping and development of products for business jet cabin 
                   systems. As co-founder of CurExplore, he worked on awareness about and access to medical trials. Across this and other 
                   professional work, he believes in influence through design, engineering, and innovation, especially related to issues he 
                   has witnessed surrounding rapid urbanization—transportation, healthcare, food, and water. Beyond this, Vivek enjoys 
                   creating through fabrication, art, and programming, and loves trekking.</p>

                 <p>As an architectural designer, she's worked on strategy-based, conceptual, and built projects in both academic 
                   and professional settings. She's led and participated in a number of prototyping/exhibition projects throughout the
                    Bay Area. She is curious about the science behind data, buildings, and everyday products, where design and engineering merge 
                    and have a larger and more global impact, especially around the topic of health and wellness. She constantly looks for challenges 
                    through multiple design competitions during her evenings and she spends her weekends on the ice, where she coaches figure skating 
                    to students of all ages.</p>

                 <p>Following undergraduate studies, Katherine’s training focused on leadership and flying acumen as an officer in the United 
                   States Marine Corps. Upon selection to the United States Naval Test Pilot School, her focus shifted to the integration of 
                   aeronautical engineering, flight test and evaluation, and project management. As a developmental test pilot, she flew new 
                   or modified aircraft to evaluate the design, bridging the gap from conception to employment, and now aims to work on the 
                   material science behind human-computer interactions in order to cultivate a brighter tomorrow.

                 <p>Saif’s professional experience has been in the NY Metro Area and the Middle East, most recently at AECOM-Abu Dhabi as an architect 
                   specializing in computational design and algorithmic modeling, with additional exposure to project management. At AECOM, his work 
                   spanned high-rise towers, healthcare, hospitality, transportation, and masterplan developments. He is dedicated to addressing problems 
                   at the interface between human behavior and the built environment, with a focus in crisis mitigation, urban displacement, and resiliency. 
                   He enjoys music and film production, and has created music videos.</p>
